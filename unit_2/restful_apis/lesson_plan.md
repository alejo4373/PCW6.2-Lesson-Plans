# Rest API

## Intro / What we are learning
## REST
  * Rules to properly use and take full advantage of the HTTP protocol
  * RESTful API aka RESTful web service

## Principles
  * Uniform interface. 
    - Using proper methods for proper actions.
    - No mixing.
    - Hierarchical and intuitive url design choice
    - Example Dog API
  * Client-Server:
    - Separation of concerns
    - No mixing of responsibilities 
    - Evolve separately
  * Stateless
    - Every request is new for the server. Has no outside context
    - All information needs to be in the request
    - State is client side
    - EXAMPLE
    - HTTP is stateless itself
  * Cachable
  * Layered
  * Code in demand

## RESTful API Endpoints
  * Primary data representation called **Resource**
    - JSON
    - XML
    - HTML document
    - YAML
  * Reached through URI/URL
  * Collections vs Singleton
## Interacting with APIs
 * Common for an endpoint to accept multiple methods
## CRUD
