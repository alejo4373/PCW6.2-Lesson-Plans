# Lesson Plan: NPM & Modules

## Exit ticket asks:
* Keyword to import module
* Where/how do we track the modules we are using (package.json)
* Core modules vs Local modules vs 3rd Party Modules
* What NPM stands for.


## Anticipating Fellow Needs:

1. What will fellows be most likely to struggle with and why? 

* Jargon. 
  * Package vs Module 
  * Module sources: Core modules vs Local modules vs Third Party modules
* Trying to import a module that is not being exported
* Install a module outside a node project and not having a `package.json`

2. What simpler assignment will you give to a struggling fellow: 
   * Create a local module, make sure to export it and the import it somewhere else 

3. What challenge assignment will you give to a fellow who is following along and ready for the next step: 
  * Explore npmjs.com and find 2 more modules and learn how to use them. Build a CLI app with them
  * Explore the `http` core module and make a network request with it to an API

## Lesson Breakdown

### Motivation
  * Share code
  * Re-use code
  * [Question] What are some of the benefits of the mentioned above?

### What is NPM
  * Stands for Node Package Manager
  * npmjs.com is where those packages are published and can be shared

### Adding Packages Dependencies

## Planning Activities:

Describe in detail. What are the instructions you will give? What will be the example you offer? How long will fellows spend on each component? How will you wrap up the activity?

### Activities for this lesson 

* In pairs: Draw “how you would solve this problem” (without telling what a LL looks like/how it works). Conclusion: One person draws their solution for the class
For class: 
3.
