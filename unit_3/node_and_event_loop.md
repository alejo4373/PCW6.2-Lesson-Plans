# Node.js & The Event Loop

## Motivation
* One language different environments
  
## What is Node.js
* [Question] What do you know about Node?
* Node.jsÂ® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
  
### Deeper into Programming Languages
#### How the computer works
* Desktops, Laptops or Mobile have chips (microprocessors)
* CPU - Central Processing Unit
* Calculations
* They only understand 1s and 0s. Electric pulse or no. (Binary)
* [Question] How is it that we are able to code in JS and the computer understands if they only understand 1s and 0s?

#### Higher Level Programming Languages
* Computers only understand Binary code. 1s & 0s
* We can't code or read binary code easily.
* 1950 Higher Level Programming Languages.
* C, Fortran, Pascal & C++
* High compiled into Binary
* Operating System is written in one of these
* Car constructor-mechanic-driver analogy from Ben Sussman

#### Interpreted Languages
* Where does JS fit? Is it compiled to Binary?
* Javascript came in 1990s to add interactions to websites on browsers
* JS not meant to run directly on the machine. Run in a browser
* Browser is a program written in a Higher Level Programing Language
* Browser INTERPRETS JS, HTML and CSS on the fly
* JS only runs on another program that interprets it
* [Question] What are those programs/environments? Node and the Browser.
* Look at Node in Github

### Google's JS Engine V8
* Definition - Go to the website 
* Browser components
