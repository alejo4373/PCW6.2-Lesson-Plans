1900-1930  Anything we would like to review from the last lab
1930-1940 Intro to Arrays and motivation
  - [EX] Give me examples of stuff we would like to keep ordered in a list
  - Often times stuff we keep in a list is of the same kind or somehow related
1940-1950 How we create arrays in JS
  - []
  - new Array()
  - Note the commas after every element
  - Array with mixed data types in JS. Even a nested array!!

1950-2000 Array properties
  - Indexed (like strings). Ask what does this mean?
  - length
  - Example str = "alejo" vs array = [1,2,3,4]. str[str.length - 1] & arr[arr.length -1]
  - demonstrate array mutability vs string

2000-2020 Add, Remove, Modify elements (Array methods)
  - push('item');
  - pop()
  - unshift('item')
  - shift()
  - nemonic technique. if a method has the letter 'u' it add/pushes to the array

2020-2030 Array methods continued
  - slice() (work the sames as in strings right?)
  - What happens if we want to remove from anywhere in the array
    - splice() changes the contents of an array by removing or replacing existing elements and/or adding new elements in place.
  - concat()
  - join(<separator>)
  - str.split(<separtor>) turn a string into an array
    - uppercasing the last char by split, editing and joining back

2030-2040 Array Equality test
  - compare with str1 === str2. Under the hood its comparing every character
  - draw internal memory
  - JS is not that nice so will have to implement our own method for arrays
  
2040-2050 Multidimensional arrays
  - Array within array
  - How to access elements
  - Why would we want this? Maps, board representations

2050-2100 Destructuring assignment
  - Example xyz coordinates
  - Swapping values of var a & b
  - not super used but can come in handy
