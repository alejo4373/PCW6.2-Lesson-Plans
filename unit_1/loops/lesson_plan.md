1900-1915 Motivations behind loops
  - Loggin nums by hand 1-100. What if we want 1-1000
  - Give me examples of real life loops. 
    - Playlist
    - Write a while loop that logs the days of the week mon-sun forever
  
1915-1935 While loop intro
  - Draw `while` loop anatomy (board drawing). 1st half of board
    - Check (...)
    - Execute (...)
    - Repeat
  - Infinite while loop nums to 10 (discussion, mem usage)
  - Fix infinite loop (why)
  - While loop that logs all odd nums (increment by 2)

1915-1945 While loop exercises, circulate
  - Write a while loop that logs all the even numbers between 0 and 100.
  - Write a `while` loop that logs all the odd numbers starting from 99, and going down to 1.
  - Share solutions

1945-2000 Illustrate `for` loop + motivation
  - Draw `for` loop anatomy (board, drawing) same as previous while
  - Note on semicolon
  - Mention `for` loop is a condensed version of while loop
  - Help me write for loop Odd & Even logging what they are next to them
  - Calculate the sum of the nums 1-10. Draw table of execution
  - Changing the increment
    - Log multiples of 5 between 5-50
    - Log multiples of 5 between 50-5 (descending)

2000-2020 For loop exercise, circulate
  - Log all multiples of 10 between 10 and 100 
  - Log all multiples of 10 between 100 and 0, descending
  - Erase both loops anotomies from board
  - Draw `for` loop and cold call random fellows to label parts
  - Share

2020-2200 Explain lab, circulate, answer Qs


=== If you are done ===
* Write a for loop to log the abecedary. Look at man page for ascii. Look at String.fromCharCode()
* Print the multiplication tables 1 to 10
